Welcome to File Synchronization program.

Main goal of this program is periodical synchronization of 2 folders and saving logs to log file and console.
Source folder, destination folder, interval of synchronizations and log.txt should be specified by user.

User should follow next steps to perform synchronization:

1. Build the program
2. Open console/terminal
3. Change directory to the folder with executable file (.exe)
4. Use command from "Prompt Command.txt" with replaced values according to user preferences.
(Quick description: Add source,destination and log paths in quotes, and specify interval of synchronization then copy and paste final command to command prompt or termianl. 

Replace quotes after --source keyword with source folder path, destination folder path in quotes after --destination keyword, and path to log.txt file.)
5. Press enter



Thank you for using/testing my Folder Synchronization project!!!
